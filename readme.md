# G-Shock Scraper

This script is designed to scrape information from the G-Shock website. I used the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries in this project. It collects details about different watch models, such as the name, photo link, and various properties. Also, this is a very interesting practice because this scraper is adapted to collect data from two parts of the site (men's watches and women's watches) using a single function.
